This enhancement allows HR staff to reliably track and validate duty schedules (e.g., ensuring a duty date is a real, future date). The implementation was challenging due to the need for robust date parsing and validation logic to handle various edge cases, such as invalid formats or past dates. I wrote unit tests to verify functionality, including positive cases (e.g., \"2025-04-15\") and negative cases (e.g., \"2020-02-30\"), which required integrating the class with the existing data model and ensuring compliance with SAF offline constraints.","lastModifiedDate":"2025-04-07","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":19,"author":{"gitId":"zihung20"},"content":"","lastModifiedDate":"2025-04-07","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":20,"author":{"gitId":"zihung20"},"content":"- **Assign and Unassign Commands**: I designed and implemented the `assign` and `unassign` commands to manage trooper duty assignments via the CLI. These commands provide the foundational structure for assigning personnel to duties and removing them, forming the basis for the later `reassign` command (a composite of `unassign` followed by `assign`). The feature is complete as it handles core use cases, such as assigning a trooper to a duty and gracefully rejecting invalid inputs (e.g., non-existent index). The difficulty arose from ensuring command consistency within the CLI framework and maintaining data integrity in an offline environment. Although the commands were later tweaked by the team, my initial setup laid the groundwork for subsequent refinements.","lastModifiedDate":"2025-04-07","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":21,"author":{"gitId":"zihung20"},"content":"","lastModifiedDate":"2025-04-07","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":22,"author":{"gitId":"zihung20"},"content":"- **Personnel Profile with Image Matching**: I developed the personnel profile feature, enabling HR staff to add and manage trooper profiles efficiently. A key enhancement was linking each profile to a photo in the local directory based on the trooper‚Äôs identity (name and NRIC). This allows for quick visual identification within the GUI while adhering to offline security requirements. The implementation was complex due to the need to design a file-matching system that dynamically retrieves images using a naming convention (e.g., `Name_NRIC.jpg`) and handles cases like missing or mismatched files. I ensured completeness by adding error handling for invalid inputs and providing feedback via the CLI, making this a user-friendly yet technically demanding addition.","lastModifiedDate":"2025-04-07","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":23,"author":{"gitId":"zihung20"},"content":"","lastModifiedDate":"2025-04-07","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":24,"author":{"gitId":"zihung20"},"content":"### Contributions to the [User Guide (UG)](../UserGuide.md)","lastModifiedDate":"2025-04-07","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":25,"author":{"gitId":"zihung20"},"content":"- **Validated UG Format and Product Specification Alignment**: I reviewed and refined sections of the UG to ensure consistent formatting (e.g., standardized command syntax presentation) and compliance with product specifications.
